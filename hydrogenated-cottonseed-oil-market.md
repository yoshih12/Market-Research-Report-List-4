<p><ul><li>Partially Hydrogenated</li><li>Fully Hydrogenated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydrogenated cottonseed oil comes in two main types: partially hydrogenated and fully hydrogenated. Partially hydrogenated oil is processed with hydrogen gas to solidify liquid oils, resulting in a semi-solid consistency that helps enhance texture and shelf life of food products. Fully hydrogenated oil undergoes further processing to remove all double bonds in the oil, making it a solid fat. Fully hydrogenated oil is often used as a trans-fat-free alternative in food products, while partially hydrogenated oil may still contain some trans fats.</p></p>
