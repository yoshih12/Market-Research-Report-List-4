<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Static Wind Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-beam</li><li>Reflective</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Static wind meters are essential tools for measuring wind speed and direction accurately. The market can be segmented into two main types: through-beam and reflective. Through-beam static wind meters operate by detecting the interruption of an emitted beam of light by wind-driven elements. Reflective static wind meters, on the other hand, measure wind parameters by analyzing the light reflected off moving particles in the wind. Both types are crucial for various applications, including environmental monitoring and industrial operations.</p></p>
