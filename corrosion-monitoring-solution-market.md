<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corrosion Monitoring Solution Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-intrusiveTechnologies</li><li>IIntrusive Technologies</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Corrosion monitoring solutions are divided into two main types: non-intrusive technologies and intrusive technologies. Non-intrusive technologies involve monitoring corrosion without physical contact with the surface being monitored, such as through ultrasonic or electromagnetic methods. Intrusive technologies, on the other hand, involve direct contact with the surface to gather data, such as using probes or sensors. Both types of monitoring solutions play a crucial role in identifying and preventing corrosion in various industries.</p></p>
