<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helmet-mounted Head Up Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inside the Helmet</li><li>Outside the Helmet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Helmet-mounted Head Up Displays (HUDs) are categorized into two main types based on their positioning: inside and outside the helmet. Inside the helmet, HUDs are embedded within the visor, providing a direct view of vital data without obstruction. This enhances user immersion and situational awareness. In contrast, outside helmet displays are mounted externally, projecting information onto a visor or a dedicated screen. This allows for broader visibility but may compromise the sleekness of the helmet design.</p></p>
