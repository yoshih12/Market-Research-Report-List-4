<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Exhaust Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial exhaust fan market comprises three main types: centrifugal fans, axial fans, and others. Centrifugal fans use a rotating impeller to increase air pressure and are ideal for high resistance environments, making them suitable for dust and fume extraction. Axial fans, on the other hand, move air parallel to the fan shaft and excel in applications requiring high airflow at lower pressures, such as in ventilation systems. "Others" encompasses specialized fans designed for niche applications, including mixed-flow and blower fans.</p></p>
