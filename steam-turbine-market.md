<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing Steam Turbine</li><li>Non-Condensing Steam Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The steam turbine market is primarily divided into two types: condensing and non-condensing steam turbines. Condensing steam turbines operate by allowing steam to expand and condense into water, maximizing energy extraction and improving efficiency, making them suitable for power generation applications. Non-condensing steam turbines, on the other hand, discharge steam without condensation, often used in industrial processes where heat recovery is essential. Both types serve distinct roles in energy production and industrial operations, catering to varying efficiency and operational needs.</p></p>
