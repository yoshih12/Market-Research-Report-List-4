<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Resin Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching</li><li>Selective-etching</li><li>Total-etching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite resin bonding agents are categorized into three main types: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching. Self-etching agents combine etching and priming in one application, simplifying the bonding process and reducing chair time. Selective-etching involves applying an acid on enamel only, allowing for a stronger bond on dentin while preserving the enamel surface. Total-etching requires separate application of an etching solution to both enamel and dentin, providing a strong bond but needing more steps. Each type offers unique advantages tailored to specific clinical situations.</p></p>
