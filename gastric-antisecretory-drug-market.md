<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gastric Antisecretory Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>H2-receptor Antagonists</li><li>Gastric Proton Pump Inhibitors</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gastric antisecretory drug market comprises three main types: H2-receptor antagonists, gastric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and other agents. H2-receptor antagonists reduce stomach acid secretion by blocking histamine receptors, providing relief from conditions like peptic ulcers and GERD. PPIs inhibit the proton pump in stomach lining cells, effectively decreasing acid production and treating similar ailments with heightened efficacy. Other agents may include a variety of medications that contribute to acid reduction, enhancing overall digestive health management options.</p></p>
