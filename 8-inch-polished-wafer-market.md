<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 8 Inch Polished Wafer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-side Polished</li><li>Double-side Polished</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-side polished wafers are polished on only one side, leaving the other side rough or unpolished. These wafers are typically used in applications where only one side needs to be smooth and flat, such as in certain MEMS and sensor applications. Double-side polished wafers are polished on both sides, resulting in a high-quality finish on both sides of the wafer. These wafers are commonly used in applications where both sides need to be smooth and flat, such as in semiconductor manufacturing.</p></p>
