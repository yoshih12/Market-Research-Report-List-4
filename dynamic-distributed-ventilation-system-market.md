<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Distributed Ventilation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Ventilation</li><li>Local Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A Dynamic Distributed Ventilation System is a type of ventilation system that can be operated on a full ventilation or local ventilation basis. Full ventilation involves ventilating an entire space or building, ensuring proper air circulation throughout. On the other hand, local ventilation targets specific areas or zones within a space, providing ventilation only where needed. This flexibility allows for customized ventilation solutions based on the specific requirements of the space or building.</p></p>
